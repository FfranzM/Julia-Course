# Exercise in breakout rooms (1 hour)

Now you will put together everything you have learned until now.

What you need:
- Notes from this workshop
- Dataset of your own
- R/python scripts used to analyzed this data


Steps:
1. Create a project folder with `DrWatson`
2. Put your data in the `data` folder
3. Put your R/python code in the `scripts` folder
4. Create a jl file with the same name as your R/python code in the `scripts` folder. For example, if your R code is called `my-scripts.r`, you will create a `my-scripts.jl` file
5. Open the jl file in VSCode (or any editor you like), and translate the R/python code into Julia
6. If you are able to share your code, fork the `julia-workshop` repository, put your `my-scripts.R` and `my-scripts.jl` in the `scripts` folder, push to your fork and then do a pull request
